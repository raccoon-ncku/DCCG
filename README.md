# ARCH3045 Design Computation and Computational Geometry

## Intro

The intersection of computational design and digital fabrication has changed how we design, analyze, and construct our built environment. Computational geometry is at the core of computational design and digital fabrication processes, from the initial form-finding stages to the actual construction. It is about algorithms and computational techniques, which can be stated in terms of geometry. The Design Computation and Computational Geometry course will explore and develop algorithms that help students create an architecture of high performance design, unimaginable forms, intricate geometries, lightweight parts with minimal material, and entirely new spatial articulation. The main topics covered in this course include algorithms, data structures, geometric operations, simulation and optimization, design-to-fabrication workflows. This course is structured around the following main activities: lectures by the instructor, weekly exercise, assignments, and a final project.
