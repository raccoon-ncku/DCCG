# Exercise Instruction
Please write a python script to make a number guessing game with the following features:

* In this game, the program generates random number but this number is not visible to the player.
* Player tries to guess the number. If the player enters the same number that is generated by system then program displays the winning message and game ends there.
* If the player enters wrong number then that number is evaluated. If the number is greater than right answer than system gives a hint that entered number is ‘high’ otherwise if number is smaller than right answer than it says ‘lower’.
