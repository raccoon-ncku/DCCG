# Recursive Functions: Branching Tree

Use the `recursive_tree.py` as a starting point for this exercise.

The program draws a tree with a given number of branches. The branches are drawn recursively, i.e. the function `branch` calls itself.
Read the code and try to understand how it works.

Modify the code to create some variation in the tree. For example, you could:
- Add spheres at the end of the branches
- Variate the length of the branches
- Variate the width of the branches
- Variate the color of the branches
- Variate the number of branches
- Randomly stop drawing branches
