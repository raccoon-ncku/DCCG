## Exercise 02: Box Projection

use `compas.geometry` to project a box to a plane.For example, `compas.geometry.Projection.from_plane_and_point()` is a method that creates a projection transformation.

tips: refer to the documentation of `compas.geometry.Box` on compas.dev or from the code editor. The documentation of `compas_view2` is also very helpful.
