## Excercise: Inventory Management
Given lists of item ids, names, prices, and quantities:

```python
item_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
item_names = ["bolt", "screw", "nail", "washer", "nut"]
item_prices = [0.25, 0.30, 0.15, 0.10, 0.20]
item_quantities = [150, 100, 10, 500, 300]
```

write a program that asks the user for an item id and prints out the name, remaining quantity, and total value of the item.

Expected result:
```
Enter an item id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]): 1
The item you are looking for is: , remaining: 0, total value: 0
