    "# 3D Convex Hull\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Convex Hull** algorithm in 3D space.\n",
    "While the 2D version creates a polygon enclosing the points, the 3D version creates a **convex polyhedron** (a mesh) that encloses all the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a cloud of points in 3D space. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that contains all these points. You can visualize it as:\n",
    "*   **Shrink-wrapping** the points.\n",
    "*   Stretching a rubber balloon around the points and letting it snap tight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting shape is a mesh composed of triangular faces.\n",
    "### Why no self-intersections?\n",
    "By definition, a **convex** object has no indentations or \"caves\". If you take any two points inside a convex object, the straight line connecting them stays entirely inside the object.\n",
    "Because the algorithm always seeks the outermost boundary that satisfies this convexity rule, it is mathematically impossible for the resulting mesh to fold over itself or self-intersect. It guarantees a clean, closed, and valid mesh.\n"
