## Access to Rhino
Though Rhino is optional, we have a license for students.

When prompted, use `zoo` as the authentication method and `zoo.rccn.dev` as the server.
It currently covers Rhino 6 and 8, and is available for Windows and Mac.

The license server is accessible only from the computer lab's wifi, and Workspace Raccoon.
## Python Installation

We use `conda` to make sure we have clean, isolated environment for dependencies.
```
(base) conda create -n DCCG python
```
### activation
```
(base)   conda activate DCCG
(DCCG)
```
