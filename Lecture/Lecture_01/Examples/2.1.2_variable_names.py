# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

# Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Legal variable names:
x = 5
_y = 6
z_a = 7

# Illegal variable names:
2x = 5
%y = 6
z a = 7

# Also, you cannot use keywords as variable names:
False = 5
None = 6
for = 7

# You can assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
