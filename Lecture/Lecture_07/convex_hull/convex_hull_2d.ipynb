    "# 2D Convex Hull: Graham Scan Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Graham Scan** algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of 2D points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.\n",
    "Imagine stretching a rubber band around the points and letting it snap tight; the shape formed by the rubber band is the convex hull.\n",
    "\n",
    "![convex_hull_2d](convex_hull.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm: Graham Scan\n",
    "Graham Scan is an efficient algorithm with time complexity $O(N \\log N)$. It works by:\n",
    "1.  **Start Point:** Finding the point with the lowest Y-coordinate (and lowest X if ties).\n",
    "2.  **Sort:** Sorting the remaining points by the polar angle they make with the start point.\n",
    "3.  **Scan:** Iterating through the sorted points and building the hull stack. If adding a new point creates a \"right turn\" (concave), we backtrack (pop) until a \"left turn\" (convex) is restored."
