# Assignment Instruction
Please write a python script that will print all prime numbers in a given range. Please leave comments in your script. Only Python and Python modules that could be installed via `conda` or `pip` could be used in this assignment.

This assignment is __10%__ of your total grade.

## Expected result
```
Please input a number: 50
There are 15 prime numbers less than 50.
They are:
2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47
```

## Requirements
- The program should ask the user to input a number, list and count all prime numbers less than the input number.
- Assume that the input is a positive integer.
- You should define at least one function in your script.
- Functions should be documented with docstrings.

## Grading Policy
For this assignment, its okay to copy and paste code from the Internet, as long as it works and you understand it. However, you should __NOT__ simply copy and paste code from your classmates. If you do so, you will get a zero for this assignment. Modify the code you found on the Internet or learned from your classmates, so that it looks different from your classmates.

- A: Your algorithm is more efficient than the regular solution.
- B: Your script works and is well documented.
- C: Your script works but is not well documented.
- F: Your script does not work.

**This grading policy only applies to this assignment.**
