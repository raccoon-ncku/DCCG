## Instruction
1. Individual or group of 2.
2. Choose an optimization algorithm, such as `Ant Colony Optimization`, `Hill Climbing Algorithm`, `Simulated Annealing`, `Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm`, etc.
3. Describe the algorithm with text, diagram, or code snippet.
4. Find a problem, such as `Traveling Salesman Problem`, `Cutting Stock Problem`, that could be possibly solved by the algorithm, either optimal or sub-optimal. The problem could also be an issue of your own design project.
5. Design/describe the problem-solving process.


## Requirements
* Write the description in `markdown` format.
* Put images and diagrams in a subfolder.
* Do not choose OneMax, Knapsack, or other course examples as your target problem.
* Please list group members in the first section of the `.md` file.

### Deliverables
* A `.md` file explaing an optimization algorithm, problems, and the process of problem solving.
* Images and diagrams if needed.


This assignment is __15%__ of your total grade. Please upload all deliverables as a `.zip` file to NCKU Moodle.

**All group members** should submit the assignment files.
