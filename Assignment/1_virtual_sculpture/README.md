## Assignment Instruction
use `compas.geometry` to create a virtual sculpture.

This assignment is __20%__ of your total grade.

# Requirements
- The sculpture must be a single object, i.e. all the elements of the sculpture must be connected. The connection only needs to be visual, so no need to boolean union the elements.
- All the elements of the sculpture must be generated by python scripts, i.e. no manual modeling.
- The sculpture must be visually interesting, i.e. not a simple box or sphere.
- The script must **not** be a simple copy of the course example. Make significant changes to the script, e.g. combine multiple examples, add new elements, etc.
- You could still use the code/idea from the Internet, except for the code from COMPAS documentation.
- You must cite the source of the code/idea in your script.
- No need to render the sculpture, but you need to take a screenshot of the sculpture.

## Grading Criteria
- Code readability
- Visual quality of the sculpture
- image quality of the screenshot
- Effort in modifying the code from the available examples
- Citation of the source

## Deliverables
- Python scripts
- Screenshots of the sculpturs in PNG format

## Submission
Submit the deliverables to the corresponding assignment on Moodle.
