## Assignment Instruction
Please write a python script to generate a virtual sculpture/installation.

* All components in the sculpture must be visually attatched together, i.e. no floating parts.
* No need to boolean all components, they just need to be __visually attatched__.
* Use COMPAS geometries.
* (Optional) The script works both in CPython and Grasshopper.

This assignment is __15%__ of your total grade. Please upload the script along with at least one screenshot (either in compas viewer, grasshopper, or a rendered image) to NCKU Moodle.
