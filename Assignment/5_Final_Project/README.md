## Instruction
* Individual or group of 2.
* Choose a problem or (part of) a project in design, architecure, urban, or computer graphic, then implement the solution or project with Python.

## Requirements
* If geometries are involved, the final presentation should be COMPAS geometries.
* Avoid using `rhinoscriptsyntax`, `Rhino.Geometry`, or `Grasshopper Components (except python component)`unless necessary. Using Grasshopper/Rhino as an user interface, data source, or presentation is generally acceptable.

### Deliverables

* Screenshots of the final results, in case your code don't work on other machines.
* Images and diagrams if needed.
* Datasets, `ghx`, `.3dm` if needed.
