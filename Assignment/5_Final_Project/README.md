# Final Project
## Instruction
The final project is an open-ended assignment. You can choose any topic you like, as long as it is related to the course. 

## Requirements and limitations
- You can __not__ simply copy an existing project from the internet. You can use an existing project as a reference, but you should implement your version in COMPAS.
- You can __not__ simply copy previous assignments.
- You can use any Python library you like, but the final result should be implemented in COMPAS.
- The project should involve some kind of geometry, either 2D or 3D, abstract or realistic. The final geometry should be displayed in a COMPAS viewer.

## Examples / Inspiration
Here are some keywords that might help you to come up with a topic:

- Recursion: tree, fractal, Koch curve, Sierpinski triangle, etc.
- Fractal spirograph
- Solar system: Agent-based modeling
- Game of Life: Agent-based modeling
- Lorenz attractor: [examples](https://www.deviantart.com/chaoticatmospheres/gallery/44050549)
- [p5js](https://p5js.org/examples/): a JavaScript library for creative coding. You could use it as a reference for your project, rewriting the code in Python and COMPAS. Some of the examples are also available in Python, using the [p5py](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

## Deliverables
- Source codes in Python
- Images or videos of the final result
- Data, configuration files, etc. if necessary

## Grading Policy
- 40%: Code quality and readability
- 60%: technical difficulty

## Deadline and Submission
- Deadline: 2024/01/12 23:55, no late submission this time as the school requires the grades to be submitted by 2024/01/17.
- Submission: upload your codes and images/videos to Moodle.
