# Final Project - Fall 2025
## Instruction
The final project is an open-ended assignment. You can choose any topic you like, as long as it is related to the course. 
Ideally it should be somne real world problem that you want to solve using computational geometry and programming. You can work individually or in groups of maximum 4 people, the size of the group will not affect the grading, but larger groups are expected to produce more complex projects.

## Requirements and limitations
- The primary programming language should be Python.
- You can use any Python library you like.
- You can __not__ simply copy an existing project from the internet. You can use an existing project as a reference, but you should implement your version.
- The project should involve some kind of geometry, either 2D or 3D, abstract or realistic.

## AI Usage
You are encouraged to use AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc. to help you with the project. However, you should not rely solely on AI to generate the code for you. You should understand the code and be able to explain it. If you use AI tools, please keep the prompt in the comments of your code for reference.

## Examples / Inspiration
Here are some keywords that might help you to come up with a topic:

- Lorenz attractor: [examples](https://www.deviantart.com/chaoticatmospheres/gallery/44050549)
- [p5js](https://p5js.org/examples/): a JavaScript library for creative coding. You could use it as a reference for your project, rewriting the code in Python and COMPAS. Some of the examples are also available in Python, using the [p5py](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
- Several python-based grasshopper component

## Submission
Each group or individual needs to create a GitHub repository for the final project. And every member should have at least one commit

## Deliverables
- Source codes in Python
- Images or videos of the final result
- Data, configuration files, etc. if necessary

## Grading Policy
- 40%: Code quality and readability
- 60%: technical difficulty

## Deadline and Submission
- Deadline: 2026/01/07 23:30
- Submission: upload your codes and images/videos to Moodle.
