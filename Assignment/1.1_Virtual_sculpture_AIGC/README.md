# Instruction
Use Stable Diffusion or other AIGC tool to convert a lineart from your previous assignment into an architecture-like image.

Your previous assignment could be a good starting point. Place your code inside the template provided in this folder and run the script to capture the image. Then use any generative AI tool to convert the image into an architecture-like image. We have a self-hosted version of [Stable Diffusion](https://app.rccn.dev/sd) available for you to use.

## Deliverables
- Several 512x512 image files of your architecture-like image.
- A 512x512 image file of your lineart.
- Source code of your lineart.

## Requirements
- The source code must be written in Python.
- The source code must be readable and well-commented.
- The final image should resemble the code output.
- You could use the result from the previous assignment as the input for this assignment, or you could use a new script to generate the lineart.
- The script must **not** be a simple copy of the course example. Make significant changes to the script, e.g. combine multiple examples, add new elements, etc.
- You could still use the code/idea from the Internet, except for the code from COMPAS documentation.
- You must cite the source of the code/idea in your script.
- You could edit the image in Photoshop or other image editing software before and/or after the AI conversion.

## Grading Criteria
This assignment is __10%__ of your total grade.
- Code readability
- Effort in modifying the code from the available examples
- Citation of the source

## Computing Resources
The [self-hosted version of Stable Diffusion](https://app.rccn.dev/sd) is provided by university resources. Please do not abuse the system. Do not modify the settings or create a large number of jobs, as
it will affect other students. If the server is down, please contact the instructor. The server will be closed soon after the deadline.

## Submission
Submit the deliverables to the corresponding assignment on Moodle.

For the deadline, please refer to Moodle.

Late submission is accepted yet the score will be lower by 2 tiers.
