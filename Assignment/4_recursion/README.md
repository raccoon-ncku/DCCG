## Assignment Instruction
use recursion to create a fractal geometry with Python.

This assignment is __15%__ of your total grade.

# Requirements
- The fractal must be generated entirely through Python scripts, with recursion as the core technique.
- The resulting geometry must demonstrate complexity beyond simple patterns (e.g., not just a line splitting into two lines).
- The script must **not** be a simple copy of the course example. You must make significant changes to the script, such as experimenting with recursion depth, combining multiple recursive approaches, or introducing unique variations.
- You are allowed to use code/ideas from the Internet but must avoid direct copying from course materials or provided examples.
- You must cite main external sources of code/ideas used in your script.
- No need to render the fractal, but you must take a screenshot of the output geometry.

## Grading Criteria
- Code readability and documentation
- Visual complexity and creativity of the fractal geometry
- Image quality of the screenshot
- Effort in customizing the code beyond basic examples
- Proper citation of sources

## Deliverables
- Python script(s)
- Screenshots of the fractal geometry in PNG format

## Submission
Submit the deliverables to the corresponding assignment on Moodle.

For the deadline, please refer to Moodle.
