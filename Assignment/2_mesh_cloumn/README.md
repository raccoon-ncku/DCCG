## Assignment Instruction
Create __3__ different mesh column models.

### Requirements
- The source code should be written in Python.
- Each model should be different from each other.
- Each model should be different from the example models.
- It's good to use other mesh processing libraries, e.g. `trimesh`, `pymesh`, `open3d`, but you should use the `compas.datastucture.Mesh` module at some point.
- You __could__ use the reference code from the lecture notes, but you should also modify it to create a different model. Modification should be __more than just changing the numbers.__
- The result should be visually interesting, i.e. not a simple box or cylinder.
- The result should be mainly generated by the script, i.e. do not simply load a mesh file and do some minor modifications.

### Grading policy
- Variety of the results.
- Visual quality of the models.
- Code quality and readability.


# Deliverables
- Source code(s) in `.py` file(s).
- Screenshot(s) of the models in `.png` file(s).
